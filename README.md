# SSVEP
Based on the frequencies of EEG signal, model decides at which diode/part of the screen person is looking (in real time).
We are getting an EEG signal in real time, and ask person to look at the diodes blinking with different frequencies - those frequencies will be visible also in our signal from the brain (SSVEP). Based on few trials like that, we make (offline) a proper callibration for given person. We analise packets of signal form 0.5s (128 samples from eight channels), count RMS for each, and label it accordingly, depending at what person was looking (left diode, right diode, screen in the middle). Those data is given to linear model (logistic regression), which is learning how to decide at which diode person is looking in real time. Next, we can run the script online, and see if our model can classify sides correctly in real time.
